abstract = {Dynamic portfolio trading system is used to allocate one's capital to a number of securities through time in a way to maximize the portfolio return and to minimize the portfolio risk. Genetic programming (GP) as an artificial intelligence technique has been used successfully in the financial field, especially for the forecasting tasks in the financial markets. In this paper, GP is used to develop a dynamic portfolio trading system to capture dynamics of stock market prices through time. The proposed approach takes an integrated view on multiple stocks when the GP evolves and generates a rule base for dynamic portfolio trading based on the technical indices. In the present research, a multitree GP forest has been developed to extend the GP structure to extract multiple trading rules from historical data. Furthermore, the consequent part of each trading rule includes a function rather than a constant value. Besides, the transaction cost of trading which plays an important role in the profitability of a dynamic portfolio trading system is taken into account. This model was used to develop dynamic portfolio trading systems. The profitability of the model was examined for both the emerging and the mature markets. The numerical results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms other traditional models of dynamic and static portfolio selection in terms of the portfolio return and risk adjusted return. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Despite growing interest and practical use, there has been little exploration of the statistical properties of random forests, and little is known about the mathematical forces driving the algorithm. In this paper, we offer an in-depth analysis of a random forests model suggested by Breiman (2004), which is very close to the original algorithm. We show in particular that the procedure is consistent and adapts to sparsity, in the sense that its rate of convergence depends only on the number of strong features and not on how many noise variables are present. {\textcopyright} 2012 G{\'{e}}rard Biau.},

This spread in excess returns is not explained by traditional risk factors, it is partially explained by transaction costs and shows behavior consistent with investor under- and overreaction. Moreover, cross-sectional currency momentum has very different properties from the widely studied carry trade and is not highly correlated with returns of benchmark technical trading rules. However, there seem to be very effective limits to arbitrage that prevent momentum returns from being easily exploitable in currency markets. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

We compare standard linear models with models that characterize the relationship between exchange rate and the underlying fundamentals by nonlinear dynamics.

In contrast, nonlinear models with more elaborate mean-reverting components dominate at longer horizons especially when deviations from long-term equilibrium are large.

abstract = {Technical analysis, also known as "charting," has been a part of financial practice for many decades, but this discipline has not received the same level of academic scrutiny and acceptance as more traditional approaches such as fundamental analysis. One of the main obstacles is the highly subjective nature of technical analysis - the presence of geometric shapes in historical price charts is often in the eyes of the beholder. In this paper, we propose a systematic and automatic approach to technical pattern recognition using nonparametric kernel regression, and we apply this method to a large number of U.S. stocks from 1962 to 1996 to evaluate the effectiveness of technical analysis. By comparing the unconditional empirical distribution of daily stock returns to the conditional distribution - conditioned on specific technical indicators such as head-and-shoulders or double-bottoms - we find that over the 31-year sample period, several technical indicators do provide incremental information and may have some practical value.},

abstract = {This entry for the Encyclopedia of Actuarial Sciences provides an introduction to the It{\^{o}} Calculus that emphasizes the definition of the It{\^{o}} integral and the description of It{\^{o}}'s Formula, the most widely used result in the It{\^{o}} Calculus. From the practitioner's point of view, the It{\^{o}} calculus is a tool for manip-ulating those stochastic processes which are most closely related to Brow-nian motion. The central result of the theory is the famous It{\^{o}} formula which one can write in evocative shorthand as df (t, B t) = f t (t, B t)dt + 1 2 f xx (t, B t)dt + f x (t, B t)dB t . Here the subscripts denote partial derivatives, and the differential dt has the same interpretation that it has in ordinary calculus. On the other hand, the differential dB t is a new object that needs some care to be properly understood. At some level, one can think of dB t as " increment of Brownian motion, " but, even allowing this, one must somehow stir into those thoughts the considerations that would make dB t independent of the information which one gains from observing {\{}B s : 0 ≤ s ≤ t{\}}, the path of Brownian motion up to time t. The passive consumer can rely on heuristics such as these to follow some arguments of others, but an informal discussion of dB t cannot take one very far. To gain an honest understanding of the It{\^{o}} integral one must spend some time with its formal definition. The time spent need not be burdensome, and one can advisably gloss over some details on first reading. Nevertheless, without some exposure to its formal definition, the It{\^{o}} integral can only serve as a metaphor. 2. It{\^{o}} Integration in Context},

We are aiming to apply various algorithms and predict the one with best outcome.

We have taken the top 25 news of the day and each news will be evaluated as if it's positive or negative and then the positive new is assigned with +1 value and so as negative with-1. For the particular day the sum of the news values are taken if the sum is positive then the predicted price will increase as compare to previous price but if the sum is negative the value should decrease base on these facts evaluation is done between predicted and occurred value and so the algorithms are used to generate the prediction and hence used to calculate the accuracy provided by the algorithm .Using news as the factor may help us in the more chance of increase in the detecting the fluctuation in the values as the news is one of the greatest factor effecting the change in stock prize as news contain the brief every possible event happened in the previous day and also contain about the company that is their release of product, status, bonds, funds, investments.},

@article{Menkhoff2007,
abstract = {Technical analysis involves the prediction of asset price movements from inductive analysis of past movements. We establish a number of stylized facts, including that technical analysis is widespread in the foreign exchange market and that it may be profitable. Wa then analyze four arguments that have been put forward to explain this: that the market may not be fully rational; that technical analysis may exploit the influence of official interventions; that it may be an efficient form of information processing; and that it may inform on nonfundanumtal influences. While each may have some validity, the latter is the most plausible.},

@article{Taylor1992,
abstract = {Technical, or chartist, analysis of financial markets involves providing forecasts or trading advice on the basis of largely visual inspection of past prices, without regard to any underlying economic or 'fundamental' analysis. This paper reports the results of a questionnaire survey, conducted on behalf of the Bank of England, among chief foreign exchange dealers based in London in November 1988. Amongst other findings, it is revealed that at least 90 per cent of respondents place some weight on this form of non-fundamental analysis when forming views at one or more time horizons. There is also a skew towards reliance on technical, as opposed to fundamentalist, analysis at shorter horizons, which becomes steadily reversed as the length of horizon considered is increased. A very high proportion of chief dealers view technical and fundamental analysis as complementary forms of analysis and a substantial proportion suggest that technical advice may be self-fulfilling.

abstract = {We use a genetic algorithm to learn technical trading rules for the S{\&}P 500 index using daily prices from 1928 to 1995. After transaction costs, the rules do not earn consistent excess returns over a simple buy-and-hold strategy in the out-of-sample test periods. The rules are able to identify periods to be in the index when daily returns are positive and volatility is low and out when the reverse is true. These latter results can largely be explained by low-order serial correlation in stock index returns.},
