     RGP implements two sets of mutation operators. The first set is
     inspired by classical GP systems. Mutation strength is controlled
     by giving mutation probabilities: 'mutateFunc' mutates a function
     f by recursively replacing inner function labels in f with
     probability 'mutatefuncprob'. 'mutateSubtree' mutates a function
     by recursively replacing inner nodes with newly grown subtrees of
     maximum depth 'maxsubtreedepth'. 'mutateNumericConst' mutates a
     function by perturbing each numeric (double) constant c with
     probability 'mutateconstprob' by setting c := c + rnorm(1, mean =
     mu, sd = sigma).  Note that constants of other typed than 'double'
     (e.g 'integer's) are not affected.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     'mutateFuncTyped', 'mutateSubtreeTyped', and
     'mutateNumericConstTyped' are variants of the above functions that
     only create well-typed result expressions.

     'mutateFuncFast', 'mutateSubtreeFast', 'mutateNumericConstFast'
     are variants of the above untyped mutation function implemented in
     C. They offer a considerably faster execution speed for the price
     of limited flexibility. These variants take function bodies as
     arguments (obtain these via R's 'body' function) and return
function bodies as results. To turn a function body into a
function, use RGP's 'makeClosure' tool function.

     The second set of mutation operators features a more orthogonal
     design, with each individual operator having a only a small effect
     on the genotype. Mutation strength is controlled by the integral
     'strength' parameter. 'mutateChangeLabel' Selects a node (inner
     node or leaf) by uniform random sampling and replaces the label of
     this node by a new label of matching type. 'mutateInsertSubtree'
     Selects a leaf by uniform random sampling and replaces it with a
     matching subtree of the exact depth of 'subtreeDepth'.
     'mutateDeleteSubtree' Selects a subree of the exact depth of
     'subtreeDepth' by uniform random sampling and replaces it with a
     matching leaf. 'mutateChangeDeleteInsert' Either applies
     'mutateChangeLabel', 'mutateInsertSubtree', or
     'mutateDeleteSubtree'. The probability weights for selecting an
     operator can be supplied via the ...Probability arguments
     (probability weights are normalized to a sum of 1).
     'mutateDeleteInsert' Either applies 'mutateDeleteSubtree' or
     'mutateInsertSubtree'. The probability weights for selecting an
     operator can be supplied via the ...Probability arguments
     (probability weights are normalized to a sum of 1). The above
     functions automatically create well-typed result expressions when
     used in a strongly typed GP run.

     All RGP mutation operators have the S3 class
     'c("mutationOperator", "function")'.

     The GP search space is defined by a set of functions, a set of
     input variables, a set of constant constructor functions, and some
     rules how these functions, input variables, and constants may be
     combined to form valid symbolic expressions.  The function set is
     simply given as a set of strings naming functions in the global
     environment. Input variables are also given as strings.
     Combination rules are implemented by a type system and defined by
     assigning sTypes to functions, input variables, and constant
     constructors.

          factory) to tag with a probability 'pw'.

          weight is associated with an object.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Function sets and input variable sets are S3 classes containing
     the following fields: '\$all' contains a list of all functions, or
     input variables, or constant factories. '\$byRange' contains a
     table of all input variables, or functions, or constant factories,
     indexed by the string label of their sTypes for input variables,
     or by the string label of their range sTypes for functions, or by
     the string label of their range sTypes for constant factories.
     This field exists mainly for quickly finding a function, input
     variable, or constant factory that matches a given type.

     Multiple function sets, or multiple input variable sets, or
     multiple constant factory sets can be combined using the 'c'
     function. 'functionSet' creates a function set. 'inputVariableSet'
     creates an input variable set. 'constantFactorySet' creates a
     constant factory set.

     Probability weight for functions, input variables, and constants
     can be given by tagging constant names, input variables, and
     constant factory functions via the 'pw' function (see the
     examples). The predicate 'hasPw' can be used to check if an object
     'x' has an associated probability weight. The function 'getPw'
     returns the probability weight associated with an object 'x', if
     available.
