# Next steps

Can either:

1. Keep working on GP
   * Try and manage to fix the rgp native functions by downloading the source file from github and editing it, for then rebuilding the package and hope changes will be effective
   * Check Cortez's book, chpt 5.2, 5.8;  can also look for more algorithms
   * Check book GENETIC ALGORITHMS AND GENETIC PROGRAMMING IN COMPUTATIONAL FINANCE

2. Use **quantomod** and **quantsrat** package to simply use TA rules (as in AF '99, Neftci '91). Sources will be:
   *  [Technical Analysis with R](https://bookdown.org/kochiuyu/Technical-Analysis-with-R/)
   *  Cortez's Modern optimization
   *  Mastering R for QF, chp 4
   
   
   
* Keep [this website](http://geneticprogramming.com/software/) in mind for several sources on GP in different languages (no R though!)
